# Vite Actix

![badge](https://github.com/Drew-Chase/vite-actix/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

Vite Actix is a library designed to enable seamless integration of the **Vite development server** with the **Actix web framework**. It provides proxying functionality to forward HTTP requests to a local Vite server during development, enabling support for features like **hot module replacement (HMR)**, while maintaining a production-ready design for serving static files.

---

## Features

- **Development Proxy**  
  Forwards unmatched HTTP requests to the Vite development server during development.

- **Hot Module Replacement**  
  Enables fast reloads of assets and code during development, boosting productivity.

- **Production-Ready**  
  Automatically serves pre-bundled assets in production without proxy overhead.

- **Customizable Configuration**  
  Supports environment variables for customizing Vite integration (e.g., working directory and port).

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Rust** (version 1.65 or higher recommended)
- **Node.js** (for Vite, version 18+ recommended)
- **npm/yarn/pnpm** (for managing front-end dependencies)

### Installation

Add the library to your Rust project by including it in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
vite-actix = "0.1.0"
```

or using git

```toml
[dependencies]
vite-actix = { git = "https://github.com/Drew-Chase/vite-actix.git" }
```

## Usage

### Basic Configuration and Setup

Follow these steps to integrate Vite with an Actix application:

1. **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**:
    - `VITE_WORKING_DIR`: Specifies the working directory containing `vite.config.[js|ts]`.
    - `VITE_PORT`: Vite server's port (default is `5173`).

2. **Example: Configuring Your Main Actix App**:
   Create a basic Actix application that includes Vite integration:

   ```rust
   use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
   use anyhow::Result;
   use vite_actix::{start_vite_server, ViteAppFactory};

   #[actix_web::main]
   async fn main() -> Result<()> {
       if cfg!(debug_assertions) {
            // Set the working directory for Vite (change this to point to the directory with vite.config.(js|ts)).
            // The library will try to automatically detect this if not explicitly set.
            set_vite_working_dir("./examples/wwwroot");
        
            // Set the port Vite should use. By default, Vite uses port 5173.
            // Changing this allows running your application with a custom Vite server port.
            set_vite_port(3000);
       }

       let server = HttpServer::new(move || {
           App::new()
               .route("/api/", web::get().to(HttpResponse::Ok))
               .configure_vite() // Enable Vite proxy during development
       })
       .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
       .run();

       if cfg!(debug_assertions) {
           start_vite_server()?;
       }

       println!("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/");
       Ok(server.await?)
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Vite Dev Server**:
    - Use `vite-actix`'s `start_vite_server` function to automatically run the Vite server in development mode.
    - Static files and modules (such as `/assets/...`) are proxied to Vite when `cfg!(debug_assertions)` is true.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
> #### Note:
> Environment variables are no longer recommended to use in rust 2024 and are thus considered unsafe.   
> Please use the functions `set_vite_port` and `set_vite_working_dir` instead.

| Variable           | Default Value | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VITE_WORKING_DIR` | `.`           | Specifies the directory containing `vite.config.ts` (or similar config). |
| `VITE_PORT`        | `5173`        | Configures the port that the Vite dev server listens on.                 |

### Proxy Rules

The following routes are automatically proxied to the Vite dev server during development:

- **Default Service**: Proxies all unmatched routes.
- **Static Assets**: Requests for `/assets/...` are forwarded to the Vite server.
- **Node Modules**: Resolves `/node_modules/...` through Vite.

Ensure that your Vite configuration is consistent with the paths and routes used by your Actix web server.
